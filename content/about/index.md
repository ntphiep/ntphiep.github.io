Hello, I'm Hiep.

If you're reading this, perhaps I should introduce myself a bit. I'm a Computer Science student and also working in the field of Information Technology, with a major in Data Engineering.

## Me

I was born and raised in a North Central province in Vietnam, but currently live, study and work in Ho Chi Minh City. Living away from home has taught me many valuable lessons. In Ho Chi Minh City, I have met many outstanding people, I have also encountered many good opportunities (and missed many üòÖ). Fortunately, I'm still young and probably still have many opportunities. I'm still in the process of growing up and improving myself...

I'm someone who doesn't know how to describe myself ü§£, maybe with each person I meet, I have a unique attitude and personality. However, there is one thing that almost everyone describes about me, which is **kindness**. I was little, I didn't like being praised for being kind, I liked being praised for being good, smart or clever (but I don't really have those üòù). However, when I grew up, I understood that kindness and goodness are also very important in everyone's life.

## This blog

Regarding this blog, I mainly created it with the simple purpose of recording and sharing some of my knowledge and experiences, sometimes translating blogs into other languages ‚Äã‚Äã(I know a little Spanish, but my English is not really good), sometimes I write random things too.

I'm not a professional writer, so I'm not sure how to write, but I'm trying my best to share my thoughts and experiences with you.
